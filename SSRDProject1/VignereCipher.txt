Details
difficulty: Easy
category: Cryptography
flags: flag{YouWin}

Description:
Your mission: decode a mysterious message, htpn{CfwExu}, to uncover a hidden flag.
But don't worry—you've got the key! Can you figure out how to use it to unlock the message?

Deployment:
The players should not get any additional files.

Soultion:
To decrypt the Vigenère Cipher, we will require a key. We will use cipher as a key.
The Vigenère Cipher works by replacing each letter in the plaintext with its corresponding
letter in the key. We can use any online decoder on Vigenère Cipher for this challenge.
The flag is gained after the key and encrypted text decoded into: flag{YouWin}
